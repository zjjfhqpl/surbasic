borZoi can be built using either an internal math library or Victor Shoup's
NTL number theory library which provides better performance. If NTL is used,
it must be first downloaded from http://www.shoup.net and installed.

GNU Development Tools:
1) (If NTL is not installed) ./configure
   (If NTL is installed)     ./configure --enable-ntl
2) make
3) make install

Microsoft Visual C++:
1) Open the borZoi.dsw file in Microsoft Visual C++
   1.1) (Only if NTL is installed)
	Replace the USE_MPI preprocessor definition with USE_NTL in the 
	preprocessor definitions section of the C/C++ tab of the Project 
	Settings dialog box.
   1.2) (Only if NTL is installed)
	Delete the math_mpi.cpp file from the source files list and replace 
	it with the math_ntl.cpp file.
2) Build.
