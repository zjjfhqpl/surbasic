	* borZoi 1.0.2: Fixed a bug in the KDF2 function which caused the
	                effective key length to be limited to a maximum of
	                160 bits. This problem did not affect the security
	                of ECKAS_DH1 because the key length is set to 128
	                bits, however the security of the 256 bit
	                symmetric key used in ECIES was reduced to an
	                effective key length of 160 bits. Corrected the
	                section on KDF2 in the manual so that the oLen
	                parameter refers to the length of the key in bytes
	                not bits.

			Replaced all occurrences of ECSecKey by ECPrivKey in
			order to use the same terminology as the standards.
			ECSecKey is defined by a macro as ECPrivKey in order
			to avoid breaking old code, but it's use should be
			avoided where possible

	                to be thrown when the key size was 192 or 256.
			Changed the DER class stream output to binary format,
			added a new HexEncoder class to provide hexadecimal 
			stream output and updated the manual to reflect this.
			Added the borZoi.vcproj file for Visual Studio.net

2002-03-25  Anthony Mulcahy  <borzoi@dragongate-technologies.com>
	* borZoi 0.9.3: Fixed some non-standard code in utilities.cpp
			that caused errors when compiling with VS.net
			on WinXP.
			Fixed the ECDSA DER encoding which was incorrect.

	* borZoi 0.9.2: Fixed an error in line 85 of ec_primitives.cpp
			Implemented a method to check the validity of the
			EC domain parameters
			Added a version of ECKAS_DH1 which takes a key 
			derivation parameter as an argument.
			Fixed some problems in src/Makefile.am
			Tidied up the eckas_dh1_ex example in test.cpp

	* borZoi 0.9.0:	Added a wrapper interface to the math functions.
			Replaced mul (F2M, Point) with (BigInt, Point).
			Added the choice of using internal math functions 
			based on the MPI math library.
